This is a simple template Java project with a basic ANT build file.

Default File Structure:
  - src/: base directory for java source code, e.g. joel.minimaljava.MinimalJava class source located at src/joel/minimaljava/MinimalJava.java
  - res/: resources directory, all resource files get packed into generated jar file.
  - lib/: libraries directory, when generating an executable jar, all .jar files present in the lib directory at compile time (including .jar files found in subdirectories) are added to the generated jar's classpath. NOTE: lib names and relative paths must be unchanged from compile time to run time.
  - bin/: directory containing .class files generated by javac.
  - build.xml: basic ANT build file to be configured for new projects.

Requires ANT to be installed on your system - see https://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html
To see possible build targets run "ant -p" (or look at build.xml).

To build the executable jar, run "ant all" in root directory or run the "./build.sh" script.
To remove all generated files, run "ant clean".
To run the executable jar, run "java -jar JAR_NAME.jar" or run the "./run.sh" script.

To configure file names and project structure, edit the build.xml file.
For executable jars, update the "mainclass" property to the Java entrypoint which will be added to the MANIFEST.MF - see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/appman.html
Update the "jar_name" property to change the generated executable.
